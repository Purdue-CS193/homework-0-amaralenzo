# Enzo's First CS193 Homework!
Enzo Alexandre Sant'Anna Amaral, Purdue Computer Science freshman

## What I like about CS193:

- The class demonstrates different important tools;
- Teaches practical skills;
- Helps students gather knowledge necessary to both CS classes and personal projects;
- Facilitates the introduction to software development job experiences.
